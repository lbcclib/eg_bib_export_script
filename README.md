# eg_bib_export_script
This is a quick BASH script written with the guidance of the official [Evergreen documentation for the marc_export support script](https://docs.evergreen-ils.org/eg/docs/latest/development/support_scripts.html#marc_export).

It exports bib records, then FTPs them to our discovery layer (EDS).
